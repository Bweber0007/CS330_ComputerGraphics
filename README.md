1. How do I approach designing software?


    What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

    A design skill that I have improved upon since working on this project would be my UI/UX designing. Through this project I have become better at understanding how changes in a UI         program can affect the UX.


    What design process did you follow for your project work?

    The design process for this project was very iterative. Since this project began while we were still learning about new concepts each week, this promoted a design process that             allowed me to incorporate these new principles as we learned them.


    How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
   
    Learning how to properly separate issues that I am working on can be an incredibly beneficial skill for future work as a software engineer. While multitasking has its benefits in         the workplace, being able to efficiently knock down individual problems, one at a time, can also be a valuable skill. 


   
1. How do I approach developing programs?

   
    What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
   
    The development approach for this project was modular. Since the program itself followed OOP principles, it facilitated the development of individual functions and sections one at a time.

   
    How did iteration factor into your development?

    Iteration was a large part of this project as well. Like I stated in the above design approach, each week allowed me to learn new concepts which could be reapplied to sections of code that I had already completed. 

   
    How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

    I don't know if my general approach to developing has really evolved throughout the project. It really just goes back to the iterative nature of the project and how I learned new concepts that could be applied.

   
4. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

   
    How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

   I would say that this class has given me new knowledge and skills that contribute to a healthy breadth of knowledge that can benefit a software engineer. While this is more of a professional pathway than an educational, I believe it to be more relevant since I am not pursuing a career directly related to computer graphics e.g. game development. I believe it is important for a good software engineer to be able to relate to and understand coworkers, colleagues, clients, or any other related group when discussing multiple facets of computer science and engineering. For example, my job might not directly relate to computer hardware, but a general understanding can be beneficial when building software for it and discussing the different applications with a computer engineer.
